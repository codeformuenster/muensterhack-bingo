# Bullshit-Bingo

## A nice little Bullshit Bingo for your meeting!

Since it's a HTML-File, you can open it easily on any platform.

Perfect for mobile devices, where you can play more discretly in the meeting!

## How to use

You can simply open the BSBingo.html file in any browser there is. Even on mobile phones.
If you click a Bingo Square, it's background will be colored red, for easy visibility.

You can also print it out, it's recommended to open it in chrome for printing (Firefox keeps messing up the table).

## How to customize

Right click the BSBingo.html file, click edit, and replace (or add new) expressions in the quotation marks.
Look where the ###### are placed, that's the right spot! ;)

....And remember to scream BULLSHIT if you get a Bingo!! :)
